\section{Introduction}
A panoramic image is a wide angle view of a particular scene. Panoramic imagery can be found in many places 
and has been used throughout history as a method to showcase large scenes in their entirety. Often, it is 
difficult to take photographs of a wide field-of-view without specialized equipement. As a result, research
in computer vision has identified methods in panorama stitching that combine multiple images with some 
overlap into a single panoramic image. Videos provide a source in which the likelihood of a panorama is high;
when a video pans, each frame overlaps with the previous to form a series of images with a wide field-of-view.

Panorama stitching algorithms consist of two main steps; aligning images together by calculating homography
values between image pairs followed by blending them together to provide a clean transition between images.
Most algorithms also require that the input images have been identified as high quality and are supplied in 
the correct order ready for alignment and blending. Additionally, panoramas are restricted by the supply of
photographs of the physical destination.

In these times, there exist vast caches of pictures and videos made available online through services such as
YouTube [REFERENCE], Vimeo [REFERENCE], Picasa [REFERENCE], and many more. These resources can provide access
to multimedia content pertaining to many places around the world. Video sources have especially become common
for many of the popular places around the world, with many of these having the potential for becoming future
panoramas. Some of these videos are not of high quality and thus cannot be used to create a panorama. In this
paper, we apply the strategy of panorama discovery in web videos identified in Liu et al [REFERENCE] with 
some improvements to shot detection and panorama discovery. The overall methodology is shown in [FIGURE XX].
